    <h3> "Rich Baby Daddy" is a song by Drake featuring American rapper Sexyy Red and American singer-songwriter SZA. “Rich Baby Daddy” is a track dipped in the essence of opulence and desire. It plays on the classic theme of entanglement between wealth, attraction, and power dynamics within relationships. With the combined lyrical prowess of Sexyy Red, SZA, and a feature by Drake, this joint is woven with the contrasts of deep emotions and the flashy hip-hop lifestyle.
